              <strong>DEAR MOTHER</strong> <br />
              <br />
              Dear mother, I know you&apos;re concerned,<br />
              About my decision to take to the streets, to be heard.<br />
              But I must stand up, for what is right,<br />
              For justice and freedom, for the light.<br />
              <br />

              Last week&apos;s demonstration, a memory so vivid,<br />
              The armed turned against us, with bullets so cruel and vivid.<br />
              Many lives lost, many left maimed and broken,<br />
              But I will not falter, my spirit unspoken.<br />
              <br />

              I&apos;ve heard of abduction, of innocent citizens taken,<br />
              In broad daylight, their rights forsaken.<br />
              But I will not be silenced, I will not be a coward,<br />
              I&apos;ll take to the streets, to be heard, to be a beacon.<br />
              <br />

              If I don&apos;t return, tell my younger siblings to be strong,<br />
              To never give up, to fight for what is right.<br />
              To use my pen to communicate, to spread the word and be bold,<br />
              To give victims a befitting send off, if need be donate blood wholeheartedly,<br />
              Together we&apos;ll rise, and this iron fist regime requiem will be conducted.<br />
              <br />

              <br />
              Upon the road from Kisumu they did tread,<br />
              With hopes and dreams within their weary heads.<br />
              Calls made to loved ones, promises were spread,<br />
              Of reunions soon, in warmth they would be led.<br />
              <br />

              At Ahero, bags of rice they did procure,<br />
              To feed their families, to make their futures sure.<br />
              But fate&apos;s cruel hand, it did obscure,<br />
              Their final journey, destiny obscure.<br />
              <br />

              In Katito, bananas and water they did buy,<br />
              To quench their thirst beneath the blazing sky.<br />
              Little did they know, they soon would fly,<br />
              To realms unknown, where sorrow does lie.<br />
              <br />

              Among them, a boy with future bright,<br />
              A leader, a preacher, or a beacon of light.<br />
              But destiny&apos;s whim, it took its flight,<br />
              Leaving behind a void, an endless night.<br />
              <br />

              Mothers weep by the roadside, hearts torn apart,<br />
              Their promises broken, dreams shattered in part.<br />
              Gifts for children, now a painful art,<br />
              As sorrow grips, and tears freely start.<br />

              <strong>HISTORY OF WAR</strong> <br />
              <br />
              In the history of war...not all wars fought were won...On all the soldiers who took the big step into the battlefield...not all came back home....
              <br />
              <br />
              The pride of war is not solely based on emerging victorious...sometimes the courage to fight...the belief of fighting for something that you believe in and the desire to bring joy to those you left behind is the greatest source of motivation for soldiers...
              <br />
              <br />
              Gen Zs had the courage to challenge the gladiators...they reminisced the challenge...they fought to the end...May the departed HEROES and HEROINES rest in Power.

              From 10 to 19, they&apos;re the ones to empower,<br />
              Their voices, their dreams, we must hear and support,<br />
              For they&apos;ll be the workers, mothers, and fathers of tomorrow,<br />
              Protected from harm, their potential we must borrow.<br />
              <br />
              Adolescent pregnancy, a threat to their fate,<br />
              Interrupted education, a loss we cannot abate,<br />

              Much appreciation to those who throw a shade of light in a dimly lit futures full of unknowns...<br />
              You are the pillars upon which humanity rests...<br />
